A personal project where I clean and analyze Nashville Housing data using SQL. This project demonstrates my data cleaning skills and SQL proficiency.

## What's in this project?

- SQL scripts for data cleaning and analysis
- Step-by-step approach to handling messy data
- Real-world data cleaning techniques

## What I did

1. **Date Standardization**
   - Converted sale dates to proper date format
   - Created a new column for standardized dates

2. **Address Data Cleaning**
   - Populated missing property addresses
   - Split addresses into individual columns (Address, City, State)
   - Standardized address formats

3. **Data Standardization**
   - Changed Y/N to Yes/No in "Sold as Vacant" field
   - Removed duplicates
   - Deleted unused columns

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL data cleaning
- Date formatting
- String manipulation

- Data quality checks


## My Analysis

In this project, I performed several key analyses on the Nashville Housing data:

1. **Property Address Analysis**
   - Identified and filled missing property addresses using ParcelID
   - Split addresses into separate columns for better analysis
   - Created standardized address formats for consistency

2. **Sales Data Analysis**
   - Standardized sale dates for temporal analysis
   - Analyzed sales patterns and trends
   - Identified potential duplicate sales entries

3. **Property Characteristics**
   - Standardized the "Sold as Vacant" field (Y/N to Yes/No)
   - Analyzed property distributions
   - Identified patterns in property sales

4. **Data Quality Improvements**
   - Removed duplicate entries
   - Cleaned up inconsistent data formats
   - Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset

5. **Key Findings**
   - Identified patterns in property sales
   - Discovered relationships between property characteristics
   - Created a clean, analysis-ready dataset

This analysis provides valuable insights for real estate professionals, market analysts, and anyone interested in the Nashville housing market trends.
